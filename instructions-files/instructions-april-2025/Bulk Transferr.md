Any chance we can do this for opportunities? I didn't happen to see open opportunities on the list :(

You can't mass transfer Opportunities with this tool without also transferring Accounts. Easiest thing to do in this case is to export a report of Opportunities, update the Owner ID and then import through Import Wizard or Data Loader.
